--Approach 1 --
SELECT customer_id
FROM customer
GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) from Product);

--Approach 2 --
SELECT C.customer_id
FROM Product AS P LEFT JOIN Customer AS C
ON P.product_key = C.product_key
GROUP BY c.customer_id 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) from product);
